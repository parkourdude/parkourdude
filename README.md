# About me 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting up to speed with all things coding. Although I'm just in my early twenties, I still occasionally feel "late to the party" as there are kids under the age of 10 already fluently engaging in software development and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about iOS and iPadOS so that I can use Swift to begin developing on there. I want to be able to create my own applications (projects) to help build my skills. I understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 📈 My goal with all of this is to be able to contribute to the growing technology of virtual reality, and engage with its potential implications. 
- 💬 Ask me about parkour if you're curious, because it's not just a cool, randomly gnereated username.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning foreign languages.
  “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.”
